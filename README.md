My solution to the Frontend Mentor task.

A very interesting task for practicing flexbox, grid, and media queries. I struggled a bit with creating an animated hamburger menu and a smoothly appearing and disappearing menu. I used a lot of pseudo-elements like before and after. I couldn't achieve a smooth menu disappearance. Only a small amount of JavaScript was needed here.
